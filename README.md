# Bug2-Camera_and_wheel_odometer_based_pose_estimation
The aim of the project is to use the wheel odometer, 2D Lidar and monocular camera as the sensors for localizing and navigating the robot in the world. The project uses Webots simulator. For navigation Bug-2 algorithm is used along with wheel odometer and camera based pose estimation.
2D Lidar is used for obstacle detection for the differential drive robot.

To run the project, follow the steps below:
  1. Clone this repository.  
  2. Open webots simulator and set the world choosing the "project_upd.wbt" present in the repo.
  3. Set the webots controller to the "project.py" python script present in the repo.
  4. Once the above steps are performed, click the run button in webots.

For in detail work of the project, please view the [Report](https://github.com/kavishmshah/Bug2-Camera_and_wheel_odometer_based_pose_estimation/blob/main/report.pdf) present in the repository.
